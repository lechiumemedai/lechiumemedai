### 0.0.2

Changed the DSL for searching associated models to allow for searching
multiple associations. 

    has_many :things
    pg_search_scope :search, :against => :name, :against_associated => {:things => :title}

against_associated accepts a hash where the key is the name of an association
and the value is structured like against. For example, the value can be a
symbol, an array with weights, etc...
